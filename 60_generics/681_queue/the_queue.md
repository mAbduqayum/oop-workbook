# Generic Queue

## Exercise: Implement a Generic Queue Data Structure

Implement a generic `Queue[T]` class that provides First-In-First-Out (FIFO) behavior. Your queue should use Python's built-in list internally but expose a clean, type-safe interface.

**Why This Matters:**

Queues are essential for managing ordered processing in software systems. Unlike stacks which process items in reverse order, queues maintain fairness by processing items in the order they arriveâ€”just like people waiting in line at a store. From print job spoolers to message queues in distributed systems, from breadth-first search algorithms to task scheduling, queues ensure operations happen in a predictable, first-come-first-served manner.

By implementing a generic queue, you create a reusable component that works with any data type while preserving type safety. Whether you're queuing customer requests, processing events, managing background jobs, or implementing a producer-consumer pattern, a well-designed generic queue provides the foundation. The type system ensures you don't accidentally mix incompatible types in your queue, catching bugs at development time rather than runtime.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Basic usage with integers
numbers = Queue[int]()
numbers.enqueue(10)
numbers.enqueue(20)
numbers.enqueue(30)
print(numbers.peek())     # 10 (first in)
print(numbers.dequeue())  # 10
print(numbers.dequeue())  # 20
print(numbers.size())     # 1

# String queue
messages = Queue[str]()
messages.enqueue("first")
messages.enqueue("second")
messages.enqueue("third")
print(messages.dequeue())  # "first" (FIFO!)

# Empty queue handling
empty_queue = Queue[float]()
print(empty_queue.is_empty())  # True
try:
    empty_queue.dequeue()  # Should raise IndexError
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Comparing FIFO vs LIFO behavior
queue = Queue[str]()
queue.enqueue("A")
queue.enqueue("B")
queue.enqueue("C")
print(queue.dequeue())  # "A" - first in, first out

# Stack would give "C" - last in, first out
```

**Advanced Example with Custom Types:**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class PrintJob:
    document: str
    pages: int
    user: str

@dataclass
class Customer:
    name: str
    ticket_number: int
    issue: str

# Print job queue (printer spooler)
print_queue = Queue[PrintJob]()
print_queue.enqueue(PrintJob("report.pdf", 10, "alice"))
print_queue.enqueue(PrintJob("invoice.pdf", 2, "bob"))
print_queue.enqueue(PrintJob("presentation.pdf", 50, "charlie"))

# Process jobs in order
while not print_queue.is_empty():
    job = print_queue.dequeue()
    print(f"Printing {job.document} ({job.pages} pages) for {job.user}")

# Customer service queue
service_queue = Queue[Customer]()
service_queue.enqueue(Customer("Alice", 101, "refund"))
service_queue.enqueue(Customer("Bob", 102, "question"))
service_queue.enqueue(Customer("Charlie", 103, "complaint"))

# Check who's next without removing
next_customer = service_queue.peek()
print(f"Next: {next_customer.name} - Ticket #{next_customer.ticket_number}")

# Serve customers in arrival order
served = service_queue.dequeue()
print(f"Now serving: {served.name} for {served.issue}")
```

**Testing Requirements:**

Your implementation should pass tests that verify:
- Enqueuing items adds them to the queue
- Dequeuing items removes and returns them in FIFO order
- Peeking returns the front item without removing it
- `is_empty()` returns `True` for empty queues and `False` otherwise
- `size()` returns the correct number of items
- Dequeuing from an empty queue raises `IndexError`
- Peeking at an empty queue raises `IndexError`
- The queue maintains type safety with different types (int, str, custom classes)
- Multiple enqueue operations followed by multiple dequeue operations maintain correct order
- The queue works correctly with None as a valid value (if T allows it)
- FIFO ordering is strictly maintained (first item in is first item out)
