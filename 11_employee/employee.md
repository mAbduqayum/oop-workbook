# üëî Python OOP Practice - Lesson 5: Employee Inheritance

## üìù Exercise: Build a Company Employee System

Create an employee hierarchy using inheritance. This introduces class relationships where specialized classes inherit from a base class.

**Your Complete Task:**
1. Create a base `Employee` class with `name`, `salary`, and `department` attributes
2. Add a `get_info()` method that prints "Employee: [name], Department: [department], Salary: $[salary]"
3. Add a `get_annual_bonus()` method that returns `salary * 0.1` (10% bonus)
4. Create a `Manager` class that inherits from `Employee`
5. Override `get_annual_bonus()` in `Manager` to return `salary * 0.2` (20% bonus)
6. Add a `manage_team()` method to `Manager` that prints "[name] is managing the [department] team"
7. Create a `Developer` class that inherits from `Employee`
8. Override `get_annual_bonus()` in `Developer` to return `salary * 0.15` (15% bonus)
9. Add a `code_review()` method to `Developer` that prints "[name] is reviewing code"
10. Create one employee, one manager, and one developer. Show their info and bonuses

**What You'll Learn:**
- Inheritance: classes sharing common attributes and methods
- Method overriding: specialized behavior in subclasses
- The `super()` function for calling parent methods
- "Is-a" relationships (Manager IS-A Employee)
- Code reuse through inheritance

**Example Usage:**
```python
# Create different types of employees
employee = Employee("John", 50000, "HR")
manager = Manager("Sarah", 80000, "Engineering")
developer = Developer("Mike", 70000, "Engineering")

# Show employee information and bonuses
employee.get_info()   # Employee: John, Department: HR, Salary: $50000
print(f"John's annual bonus: ${employee.get_annual_bonus()}")  # John's annual bonus: $5000.0

manager.get_info()    # Employee: Sarah, Department: Engineering, Salary: $80000
print(f"Sarah's annual bonus: ${manager.get_annual_bonus()}")  # Sarah's annual bonus: $16000.0
manager.manage_team() # Sarah is managing the Engineering team

developer.get_info()  # Employee: Mike, Department: Engineering, Salary: $70000
print(f"Mike's annual bonus: ${developer.get_annual_bonus()}")  # Mike's annual bonus: $10500.0
developer.code_review()  # Mike is reviewing code
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Employee base class with name, salary, department
- ‚úÖ get_info() and get_annual_bonus() methods in base class
- ‚úÖ Manager class inherits from Employee and overrides bonus calculation
- ‚úÖ Developer class inherits from Employee and overrides bonus calculation
- ‚úÖ Manager has manage_team() method, Developer has code_review() method
- ‚úÖ All objects created and methods working correctly
