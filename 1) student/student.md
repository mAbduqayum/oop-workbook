# Python OOP Questions for Beginners

## 1. Question 1: Make Your First Class

Create a `Person` class with just a `name` attribute. Make a person object and print their name.

*This teaches: Basic class syntax, **`__init__`**, creating objects.*

## 2. Question 2: Add a Simple Method

Add a `say_hello()` method to your `Person` class that prints "Hello, my name is [name]". Create a person and make them say hello.

*This teaches: Methods, **`self`** parameter, using attributes in methods.*

## 3. Question 3: Make Multiple Objects

Create 3 different `Person` objects with different names. Make each person say hello to see that they're separate objects.

*This teaches: Multiple instances, each object has its own data.*
