## Exercise: Student Class

Create a `Student` class that manages student information and grades.

### Your Task:
1. Create a `Student` class with `name`, `student_id`, and `grades` (empty list) attributes
2. Add an `add_grade(grade)` method that adds a grade to the grades list and prints `f"Added grade: {grade}"`
3. Add a `calculate_average()` method that returns the average of all grades

### Example Usage:
```python
student = Student("Alice", "S123")
student.add_grade(85)    # Added grade: 85
student.add_grade(92)    # Added grade: 92
student.add_grade(78)    # Added grade: 78
print(student.calculate_average())  # 85.0
```
