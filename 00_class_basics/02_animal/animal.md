## Exercise: Animal Cass

Create an `Animal` class.

### Your Complete Task:
1. Create an `Animal` class that takes `name` and `species` in the constructor
2. Add a `make_sound()` method that prints `f"{name} makes a sound!"`

### What You'll Learn:
- Working with multiple attributes in a single class
- Creating methods that use multiple pieces of object data

### Example Usage:
```python
dog = Animal("Buddy", "Dog")
print(f"Name: {dog.name}, Species: {dog.species}")     # Name: Buddy, Species: Dog
dog.make_sound()   # Buddy makes a sound!
```
