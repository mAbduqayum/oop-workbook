# Python Workbook Project

This is a structured collection of Python programming exercises designed for learning and practice.

## Project Structure

- Each exercise is in a numbered directory
  - `0**` class basics
  - `1**` class inheritance
- Exercise directories contain:
  - `*.md` file with problem description, examples, and formulas.
- Reference materials are in `x0_*/` directories

## Exercise Categories

- **Basic I/O**: Hello world, user input/output
- **Computer Science**: Arithmetic, geometry, area/perimeter calculations
- **Mathematics**: Arithmetic, geometry, area/perimeter calculations
- **Physics**: Free fall, ideal gas law, pressure conversions
- **Chemistry**: Free fall, ideal gas law, pressure conversions
- **Biology**: Free fall, ideal gas law, pressure conversions
- **Finance**: Interest calculations, tip calculators, banking
- **Time/Date**: Time conversions, date calculations
- **Utilities**: Sorting, string manipulation, unit conversions

## Testing and Validation

- Manually verify outputs match the examples in the `.md` files
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions

## Exercise Workflow

1. Read the `.md` file to understand requirements
2. Verify outputs match examples exactly
3. Test mathematical formulas independently
4. Fix any calculation or formatting errors
5. Ensure all examples produce correct results
