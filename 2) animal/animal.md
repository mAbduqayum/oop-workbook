# Python OOP Questions for Beginners

## 1. Question 1: Create an Animal Class

Create an `Animal` class with `name` and `species` attributes. Create an animal object and print both attributes.

*This teaches: Multiple attributes, basic class structure.*

## 2. Question 2: Add Animal Behavior

Add a `make_sound()` method to your `Animal` class that prints "[name] makes a sound!". Create different animals and make them make sounds.

*This teaches: Methods with attributes, basic behavior.*

## 3. Question 3: Different Animal Types

Create 3 different `Animal` objects representing a dog, cat, and bird. Make each animal make a sound to show they're independent objects.

*This teaches: Object independence, same class different data.*
